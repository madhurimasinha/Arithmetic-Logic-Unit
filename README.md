**Arithmetic Logic Unit**

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations within a processor.
This work descirbes the working of an ALU that has been implemented using different arithmetic and logical operations.
It takes two input values and performs the necessary operation depending on the control signal, which will be provided as a third input value and produces the respective result. The control signal describes the type of operation that needs to be performed on the inputs provided.

VLSI techniques allows us to design ALUs that are faster in execution of operation, better in power-efficiency, compact and reliable for the modern processors.
